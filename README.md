This project try mix the amazing  https://data.sfgov.org "film location in San Francisco" with open source and free data resources like

- YQL (thanks for give me the correct coordinates for every single location)
- Freebase (the central db for the internet)
- omdbapi for providing me the movie poster urls


Only a small data is stored in the html, the majority is obtained using google freebase

Many thanks to
- React (finally I feel than I can create frontend projects)
- UIKIT

and of course:
- Programmr http://www.programmr.com/
- Hired https://hired.com/

for this amazing opportunity..many thanks!!!...


IMPORTANT NOTE:
- I didnt know than for this contest we could use tools like github,db's and storage...so I develop this project using only a small json and retrieving all the content dynamically from freebase,google maps etc..
the data is automatically generated WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION :D, so, in some cases could have mistakes (hope not so much).....



the project needs some fixes and improvements and better documentation ...


thanks!
